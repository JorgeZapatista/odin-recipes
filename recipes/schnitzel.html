    This wiener schnitzel is an easy German recipe and one of our favorites. Boneless pork chops can also be substituted for veal and taste excellent!
    <p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Veal: This recipe starts with 1 ½ pounds of veal cutlets.</li>
        <li>Flour and eggs: Dredging the veal in all-purpose flour and eggs ensures a perfectly crispy finished product. </li>
        <li>Cheese and milk: Add Parmesan cheese and milk to the egg mixture to add flavor and help lock in moisture.  </li>
        <li>Seasonings: Season the wiener schnitzel with minced parsley, salt, pepper, and nutmeg. </li>
        <li>Bread crumbs: Use store-bought dry bread crumbs or make your own at home. </li>
        <li>Butter: Cook the breaded veal cutlets in butter on the stove. </li>
        <li>Lemon: Garnish the wiener schnitzel with lemon slices.</li>
    </ul>
